This project is an application developed to provide inventory information in accordance with the COVID-19 Mask Public Sales Policy in Republic of Korea.

As the Korean government abolished the public mask sales system from July 12, 2020, the service was terminated. The API does not work now.

This application was installed by a total of 30K+ users during the period of operation of the public mask sales system, with 17 users leaving 17 assessments, and a rating of 4.412.

Please understand that the code pattern of the project is not smooth because we created the application for a short period of time. If you have any questions regarding this project, please send us a Github personal email.
